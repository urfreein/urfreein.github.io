## 1. God of War Returns to Norse Mythology

In 2018, the PlayStation exclusive God of War was released.
It was a complete transition from Greek mythology to Norse mythology.

### 1.1 From Revenge to Paternal Love

Kratos was no longer the god of vengeance.
He had become a clumsy father on a journey to scatter his deceased wife's ashes.

It's a journey taken with his son Atreus.
What a tremendous transformation, isn't it?

The Norse mythology series concluded with Ragnarök in 2022.
Both works center on the father and son.

### 1.2 A Son Who Grew Up with the Game

When I first played God of War (2018).
My son was around the same age as Atreus in the game.

And four years later, when playing Ragnarök.
My son had also become a teenage boy.

Just like Atreus in the game.
What a thing to witness over time.

## 2. 2018: The Days of Being Called "Boy"

### 2.1 A Distant Form of Address

In God of War (2018), Kratos never called his son by name.
He always just called him "Boy."

This brief but cold form of address.
It perfectly showed their relationship:

- A father awkward at expressing emotions
- A son wanting recognition
- A distance that couldn't be bridged

### 2.2 Endless Questions

Throughout the game, the two keep conversing.
Kratos's short answers and Atreus's questions.

My son was exactly the same at the time:
- "Dad, what's this?"
- "Dad, what about that?"
- "Dad, why is that?"

While playing the game, I deeply empathized with Kratos's feelings.
Questions that were hard to answer. Moments when I didn't know how to explain.

### 2.3 Someone to Protect

What's at the core of the 2018 game?
It's Kratos trying to protect his son.

During dangerous fights, he always sent his son away.
Atreus helped his father by keeping enemies at bay with his bow.

It was both part of the combat system and the heart of the story.
A son who already showed warrior qualities despite his young age.
But still someone who needed protection.

## 3. Ragnarök: Atreus Hits Puberty

### 3.1 Changes During Fimbulwinter

Ragnarök takes place three years after the previous game.
Atreus has become a 14-year-old adolescent.

His voice has deepened, and his build has grown.
He's no longer just a child who needs protection.

The biggest change was his attitude:
- Rebelling against his father's instructions
- Acting independently
- Exploring his own identity

### 3.2 "Boy" Called Again

In Ragnarök, Kratos no longer calls him "Boy."
Now he calls him by name: "Atreus."

There's only one exception.
When Atreus secretly went to Asgard and got caught.

Kratos shouted in a tone he had never used before:

**"Boy!"**

It was such an intense scene.
My spine tingled watching it. ㅠ.ㅠ

Atreus must have felt the same way.

### 3.3 Father and Son in Conflict

From the early part of the game, the two keep clashing.

**Kratos's perspective:**
- "You'll get into danger"
- "You're not ready yet"
- "I need to protect you"

**Atreus's perspective:**
- "I'm not a child anymore"
- "Father doesn't trust me"
- "I can do it"

This conflict dynamic was so realistic.
Our son was exactly the same.

## 4. The Changing Kratos

### 4.1 From God of Vengeance to Father

The Kratos from the Greek mythology series?
He was the embodiment of destruction and revenge. He killed gods and destroyed Olympus.

The Kratos from the Norse series is different:
- Someone who reflects on past mistakes
- A father trying to suppress his emotions
- A person wanting to give his son a better life

### 4.2 A Father Holding Back Tears

Kratos's emotional acting in Ragnarök.
Isn't it truly excellent?

You can see him holding back tears in several scenes.

Particularly impressive moments:
- When Atreus was in danger
- When recalling the past
- After conflicts with his son

The emotions of a father in his 40s-50s are conveyed directly.
Things that can't be expressed in words but are conveyed through his eyes.

### 4.3 The Decision to Let Go

In the latter part of the game, Kratos makes an important decision.
He decides to trust Atreus and let him go.

"You are ready."

The weight contained in this short phrase.
Isn't this a moment every parent must face someday?

## 5. When Reality and Game Overlap

### 5.1 Growing at the Same Pace

When playing the 2018 game.
Our son was young:

- Always full of questions
- Wanted to be with dad
- Was someone who needed protection

When playing Ragnarök.
Our son was a teenager:

- Wants to be alone
- Doesn't listen to parents well
- Creates his own world

Atreus in the game and my real son.
They were growing at the same pace.

### 5.2 Deeper Empathy

That's why the father-son conflict scenes in Ragnarök resonated more deeply.

I saw myself in Kratos worrying about Atreus.
I saw our son in Atreus's frustration.

It was a game, but it wasn't just a game.
It was a microcosm of actual parent-child relationships.

### 5.3 The Process of Understanding Each Other

As the game progresses, the two characters understand each other:
- Kratos acknowledges his son's growth
- Atreus understands his father's concerns

Isn't reality the same?
As time passes, parents and children gradually understand each other better.

## 6. Atreus Playable Sections

### 6.1 Controversial Sections

Ragnarök has parts where you directly play as Atreus.
Many gamers found these sections boring:

- "I want to play as Kratos"
- "Atreus is weak and frustrating"
- "I want to return to Kratos quickly"

### 6.2 A Different Perspective

But I found playing as Atreus fun.

Why?
Because I could experience being in a teenage son's shoes:

- The feeling of adventuring alone without parents
- Freedom along with anxiety
- Abilities that aren't perfect yet

It wasn't frustration, but the reality of a teenage adolescent.
Isn't that excellent?

### 6.3 The Process of Growth

In Atreus's playable sections, you directly feel his growth:
- He's clumsy at first
- Gradually becomes more skilled
- By the end, he's quite warrior-like

This also resembles reality.
Children learn through mistakes. Parents can't prepare them perfectly.

## 7. Voice Actors' Emotional Performances

### 7.1 Outstanding Acting

The voice acting in the God of War series.
It's truly outstanding:

- Christopher Judge (Kratos)
- Sunny Suljic (Atreus - 2018)
- Ben Prendergast (Atreus - Ragnarök)

Ben Prendergast's performance in Ragnarök was particularly impressive.
He perfectly expressed the unstable emotions of a teenage boy.

### 7.2 Delicate Emotional Lines

Throughout the game, the emotional changes of both characters are delicately expressed:
- Kratos's suppressed emotions
- Atreus's confused heart
- The tension between the two

Every line, every expression has meaning.

### 7.3 Parental Empathy

If you're a parent gamer in your 30s-40s?
You'll empathize more deeply with this game's emotional lines.

The difficulties of raising children, awkwardness in emotional expression, and love.
Everything is contained in the game.

## 8. About the Puzzles

### 8.1 A Divisive Element

The puzzles in the God of War series.
Reviews are mixed:

- Those who like them: "Appropriate difficulty"
- Those who dislike them: "Breaks the pace"

The bell-ringing puzzles in particular received much criticism.
They were criticized for being monotonous and repetitive patterns. (I agree ㅡ.ㅡ;;)

### 8.2 From a Puzzle-Loving Perspective

I like puzzle games.
I enjoyed most of God of War's puzzles too.

Except for the bell-ringing, other puzzles were fun:
- Pathfinding using the environment
- Problems requiring logical thinking
- Naturally connected to the game's worldview

Continuous action gets tiring.
Puzzles serve as appropriate breathing spaces.

### 8.3 The Joy of Exploration

God of War isn't a linear progression game.
There's fun in exploring wide maps and finding hidden elements.

Puzzles are part of this exploration.
You solve puzzles to access new areas and get rewards.

Simple, isn't it?

## 9. Summary

The God of War Norse series.
It's not just a simple action game. It's a growth drama of father and son.

### 9.1 Meaning Beyond Gaming

What I felt while playing this game:
- Universal truths of parent-child relationships
- Relationships that change with time
- The importance of emotional expression
- The process of understanding each other

### 9.2 An Experience of Growing Together

From 2018 to 2022.
Atreus in the game and my real son grew up together.

While playing the game, I felt and learned many things as a parent.
Kratos's concerns were my concerns.

### 9.3 Recommended For

I especially recommend this game to:
- Parent gamers in their 30s-40s
- Those contemplating their relationships with children
- Those wanting deep storytelling
- Those wanting both action and emotion

God of War is a game, but it contains a part of life.
That's what makes it special.

What a thing to witness over time.
