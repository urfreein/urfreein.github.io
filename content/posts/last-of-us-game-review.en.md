## First Encounter with That Game

Among the games I enjoyed before and still enjoy now, there's a game called "The Last of Us."
Although it was originally released for PS3, I bought and first played the PS4 Remastered version.

It truly felt like watching a drama.
I think I played it with sweaty palms.
The game's storyline was so impressive.

At the time, my expectations for the game weren't high.
I just thought I'd give it a try since it had good reviews.
But within a few hours of starting the game, I was completely hooked.

## Part 1 - Between Survival and Humanity

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world.
It's a world where human civilization has collapsed due to fungal infection.

The protagonist Joel lives with the pain of losing his daughter.
Then he meets Ellie, a girl with immunity.
At first, it was just a transport mission.

But as they journey together, their relationship changes.
For Joel, Ellie becomes someone who fills the void left by his lost daughter.
For Ellie, Joel becomes a father figure.

The gameplay was excellent too.
Stealth and action are properly mixed.
Resources are always scarce, and tension continues until the end.

But the real value of this game is its storytelling.
Naughty Dog created a drama through gaming that rivals movies.
You can genuinely feel the characters' emotions.

Joel's final choice is truly controversial.
He threw away the opportunity to save humanity.
But it was to protect Ellie.

Was it the right choice?
This question carries into Part 2.

## Part 2 - A Shift in Perspective

And later, Part 2 was released.
The storyline gave us even more to think about than Part 1.

Many gamers disliked Part 2.
I understand their reasons.
Shocking things happen to beloved characters.
Players have to control characters they don't want to control.

But I can't agree with that opinion.
Part 2 was really fun and exciting.
Most importantly, the storyline was impressive.

### Why Was It Controversial

The beginning of Part 2 is shocking.
Something terrible happens to Joel.
Many gamers were outraged seeing this.

And the game doesn't give players a choice.
You have to follow Ellie's revenge journey.
And in a very cruel and violent way at that.

The bigger problem is the middle part.
Suddenly it switches to the perspective of a character named Abby.
The very person who killed Joel.

Gamers hated Abby.
But the game makes you play from Abby's perspective.
This was truly a bold choice.

### But That Made It More Impressive

At first, I hated Abby too.
Controlling her felt uncomfortable.
I wanted to quickly return to Ellie.

But as I listened to Abby's story, my thoughts changed.
Abby had her own reasons too.
I learned that Joel had killed Abby's father.

That father was the doctor who was trying to make a vaccine from Ellie.
The very person Joel killed at the end of Part 1.

From the other side's perspective, such things could certainly happen.
Given the game's background situation, it's a world where good and evil don't necessarily exist.

### The Message of Perspective Shift

Naughty Dog's intended message is clear.
Revenge breeds revenge.
Everyone has their own reasons and justice.

From Joel's perspective, he's a hero who protected Ellie.
But from Abby's perspective, he's her father's enemy.

From Ellie's perspective, Abby is the villain who killed Joel.
But from Abby's perspective, she was just getting revenge.

This game asks the player:
"Who is really right?"
"Where does revenge end?"

## The Discomfort the Game Brings

Part 2 is not a comfortable game.
It's continuously uncomfortable while playing.
You see and directly commit brutal violence.

Enemies call each other's names.
"David! David is dead!"
Lines like this appear.

When you kill a dog, its owner grieves.
When you kill a pregnant woman, her comrade wails.

The game makes players feel guilt.
Is this really the right thing to do?
It keeps asking.

Some gamers disliked this discomfort.
Aren't games supposed to be fun?
Why make it so uncomfortable?

But I think that's the purpose of this game.
There's no good and evil in war.
Everyone fights for their own reasons.

Making you feel that discomfort is precisely the message.

## Naughty Dog's Courage

Part 2 was a commercially risky choice.
To kill a character that gamers love?
To make gamers control a character they hate?

But Naughty Dog told the story they wanted to tell.
They didn't compromise.
This was truly a courageous thing to do.

The gaming industry prefers safe choices.
Sequels usually follow the formula of their predecessors.
But Part 2 took a completely different path.

The results were starkly divided.
While some call this game a masterpiece,
others call it the worst game ever.

But either way, Part 2 is not forgotten.
It gives you something to think about.
Isn't that the role of art?

## What I Felt

That emotion when I first played Part 1.
The discomfort and shock I felt playing Part 2.
And the lingering feeling left at the end.

These games left a big impression on me.
They weren't just games for simple fun.
They were games that made you think.

Actually, the games' completion level is also amazing.
Graphics, sound, acting - everything is near perfect.
Technically, they were at the highest level of their time.

But more important than that was the story.
About human nature.
About revenge and forgiveness.
About the balance between survival and humanity.

It was amazing to address these themes through gaming.

## Naughty Dog's Other Games

By the way, Naughty Dog has made other famous games too.
I've enjoyed those games immensely as well.
I plan to write about them separately later.

Naughty Dog is a company strong in storytelling.
They elevate games from simple entertainment to the realm of art.
I'm looking forward to their next work too.

## Living Long Enough to See It All

Just 10 years ago, games were simple entertainment.
But now it's different.
Games can now convey stories as deep as movies or dramas.

The Last of Us series showed that possibility.
That games can ask heavy questions to players.
That causing discomfort can also be a game's role.

Technology continues to advance.
Games continue to evolve.
I'm truly excited about what games will come in the future.

## In Closing

If you haven't played The Last of Us yet, I highly recommend it.
But prepare yourself mentally before starting.
It's not a comfortable game.

Part 2 is even more so.
It's a controversial game, but that makes it all the more meaningful.
It gives players something to think about.

Not every gamer needs to love this game.
But it's definitely worth experiencing.
Because it shows how far games can go.

Let's pay attention and observe carefully.
The future of gaming is bright.
And that future has already begun.
